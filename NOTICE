This project was developed as part of the NCI CBITT initiative.

caGWAS started as a project of the larger caBIG initiative, with the goal of allowing researchers to integrate, query, report, and analyze significant associations between genetic variations and disease, drug response or other clinical outcomes.
The project was initially developed by SAIC under funding from the CBIIT office of the National Cancer Institute.

In 2012, as part of NCI's Open Source Development Initiative (OSDI), caGWAS
was migrated to a more open environment and pursued a larger community of
contributors.

# The configurations options for apache are very diverse.  Below is a sample that may be 
# use to configure apache to work with the cagwas application.  This file is generated
# based on values provided in the properties file of the build, if set correctly this 
# file may be able to be used with very little change.  
#
# There are two general options with apache configuration.  First is to use one file 
# to hold all configuration information.  Second is to use include in your main httpd.conf
# and include  <config_directory>/*.conf.  If your configuration uses includes then you
# can copy this file in to the <config_directory>, after some edits, restart apache and
# things should work.  
#
# Things you may want edit.
#   1. You may not use virutal hosts then you should be able to put most settings under
#       the default configuraiton
#   2. You might need NamedVirutalHost configured.
#   3. You may want to configure additional ServerAliases
#   4. You maw want to use separate log files for this vhost.
#   5. You may want to have allow lists on each of the directories.
#   6. You will have to chose a method to secure the "/authenticated_browse" directory.
#        
# NameVirtualHost @apache.virtual.ip@:@apache.virtual.port@ # may or may not need this

<VirtualHost @apache.virtual.ip@:@apache.virtual.port@>

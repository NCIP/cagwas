Good morning, Subha  - 

 

Do you concur with submitting the release to Staging for this build of CaGWAS v1.3?

 

CaGWAS v1.3 was built and installed on the QA server for build tags QA_CaGWAS_24JUL07_01 (all test cases). Testing was performed using IE7 and FireFox v2.x on Windows XP for the following test cases:

 

·  Test Case 1:  Authenticate User - Pass

·  Test Case 2:  SNP Association Finding Search by SNP Panel – Pass

·  Test Case 3:  Population Frequency Findings Search by SNP Panel –  Pass 

·  Test Case 4:  Study Participant (Subjects Data) Search – Pass

·  Test Case 5:  Bulk Data Download – Fails on login for Subjects and Genotypes data files

·  Test Case 6:  Secure Login and Data Access Process Verification - Fails 

·  Test Case 7:  Defect retests – # 8092 (Study access is cached by the browser) is open; #7892 resolved; # 8057 resolved (Any LDAP account can access all bulk download files);

·  Test Case 8: Selenium tests: Performed from the scripts in the \Individual_test_files folder

 

No JMeter stress testing was performed during this testing cycle. Test results have been checked in to GForge.

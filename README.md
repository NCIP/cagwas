Welcome to the caGWAS Project!
==============================

Cancer Genome-Wide Association Studies (caGWAS) allows researchers to integrate, query, report, 
and analyze significant associations between genetic variations and disease, drug response or 
other clinical outcomes.New breakthroughs in SNP array technologies make it possible to genotype 
hundreds of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) simultaneously, enabling whole 
genome association studies. Within the Clinical Genomic Object Model (CGOM), the caIntegrator 
team created a domain model for Whole Genome Association Study Analysis. 
CGOM-caGWAS is a semantically annotated domain model that captures associations between Study, 
Study Participant, Disease, SNP Association Analysis, SNP Population Frequency and SNP annotations.

caGWAS is developed in Java and requires Apache Ant for building.
